        <h1>JS NES assembler</h1>
        <p>A small assembler to compile NES games directly in the browser.</p>
        <p>
            Currently it only supports linking to NROM 128. It also has some
            major differences with some more advanced assemblers: Numbers can
            only be in hex, so you shouldn't put a '$' in front of them. I plan
            to change that in the future, it's in a very early state.
        </p>
